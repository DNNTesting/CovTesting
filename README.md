Codes for paper: Correlations Between Deep Neural Network Model Coverage Criteria and Model Quality



We use [clevenhans](https://github.com/tensorflow/cleverhans) to construct attacks, and use [adversarial-robustness-toolbox](https://github.com/IBM/adversarial-robustness-toolbox) to do adversarial training. Before start, please install the required dependencies according to the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/DNNTesting/CovTesting/blob/master/requirements.txt) file.
