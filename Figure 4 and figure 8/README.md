Currently, DeepGuage is upgraded to version 2.0, and incorporated into their another recent work DeepHunter:

I have put all of the models used in SADL and DeepGauge in :

The DeepGauge profile includes 7 profiling files (for 5 trained models and 2 ImageNet models in Keras) required for coverage analysis in DeepGuage. 5 trained models include LeNet-1 LeNet-4 LeNet-5 VGG16 and ResNet-20. For model MobileNet and RestNet-50, they use pre-trained weights from Keras2.1.3.
